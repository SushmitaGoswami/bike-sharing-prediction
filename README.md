# bike-sharing-prediction

Prediction of bike sharing Project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Project Overview

In this project, I built a simple neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership. The data set consists of the bike sharing data for the big cities of United States and has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012.
